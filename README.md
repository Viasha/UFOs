# UFOs
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to use my acquired skills in JavaScript and HTML to create a dynamic organized table from an array of data from a JavaScipt file. The data within the table can be filtered for multiple criteria at the same time. Using Bootstrap, CSS, HTML and JavaScript code I was able to create this webpage to track the sighting of UFOs.
## Results
The dynamic webpage titled UFO Sightings has a dark view that's easy on the viewers eyes with a view of Earth from outerspace.

Below the brief paragraph you will see the default table with a "Filter Search" region beside it.

You can filter the table by City, State, Country or shape of UFO. Once an input is entered, the appropriate results will be shown amongst the table of information. If I wanted to achieve a search for my hometown, Cleveland, I would enter the city to yield my results on the table. See image below

Likewise for state using the abbreviation for the state.

The table will update with each criteria inputted into the Filter Search region. You can even have multiple filters applied at once. 
In the image below I entered an input for Date and State narrowing down the UFO sightings to 1 event.

## Summary
This is a rough, but good start to a functioning webpage to search for UFO sightings. The major drawback would be the requirements for the input text. The text must be lower case because the field is case-sensitive. This will cause problems for everyday users because cities and states are traditionally capitalized.
Also the abbreviations for the states are only acceptable input. Some viewers may type out the entire name of the state instead. This could lead to misleading information. 
To further improve this webpage I would include customizations to accept any form of city and state including the abbreviation or full name. 
I would also encorperate an "Enter" or "Search" button so the viewer can ensure they have entered the search. The table does not update until the viewer has moved to another criteria. This could be confusing making the viewer unsure if they are seeing an updated search or the previous search.
